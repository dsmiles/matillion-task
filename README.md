# Matillion Task
June 19, 2024

## Platform
- CoderPad.io online Test Platform
- SpringBoot Application

## Details of task
Details of task to be added later (maybe).

## Result
I wasn't able to complete the task within the given timeframe, but I was able to get the SpringBoot application to retrieve data from the Pexels REST API, extract the "best image" using the given success criteria and return a response.

```http response
{
  "url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/132477/pexels-photo-132477.jpeg",
  "photographer": "Anthony ðŸ™‚",
  "alt": "Clear Water Drops"
}
```

I created some basic test classes for the controller, service and repository levels, but these were not compiling due to problems with dependencies in the POM file.

However, I was able to recreate the SpringBoot project on my local machine in the evening and fixed those problems (incompatible library versions). I also forgot to add the `spring-boot-starter-test` to the dependencies (which didn't help).

## Things to-do
1. Add more error checking to the application code
2. Add more HTTP status codes (errors, etc) 
3. Add more application logging using log4J or something similar (better for debugging)
4. Add more tests to each level (controller, service, repo - missing values, bad responses, etc)
5. Add some E2E API level test cases using REST-Assured
6. Add some security tests (unsupported HTTP verbs, missing API keys, etc)
7. Add some performance test (isolated from external APIs)

## Additional features
1. Add ability to get the "best image" for a given subject. This would involve adding methods to the controller, service and repository classes to `findBy(subject)`. For example, Ocean, Tigers, Nature, Science, etc.
2. Add ability to search for more than 10 items per page

## API Key
The API key has been removed from the code. It can be set via system environment variable, or from the command line. In my case, I've configured a profile within IntelliJ to set the key via System Env.

## Usage

To run the test framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dsmiles/covid-19-statistics-api.git
    cd covid-19-statistics-api
    ```

3. Set the API_KEY environment variable (as per your OS or IDE)


3. Run the Maven test command:
    ```
    mvn clean test
    ```

## Gitflow
I might add a GitFlow CI profile to build this on a push to GitHub.
